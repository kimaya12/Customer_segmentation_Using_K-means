# Customer_segmentation_Using_K-means

This GitHub repository hosts a customer segmentation project aimed at analyzing customer data to identify distinct segments for targeted marketing strategies. Using machine learning algorithms such as K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering, we segment customers based on their behavior, demographics, and purchasing patterns. The project includes data preprocessing scripts, exploratory data analysis notebooks, and implementation of clustering algorithms. Additionally, it provides visualization tools to interpret and communicate segmentations effectively. Collaborators and contributors are welcome to explore, contribute, and enhance the project for better customer understanding and business insights.
